osu! is a rhythm-based online game that challenges players to hit circles, sliders, and spinners in time with the beat of the music. Originally inspired by the Nintendo DS game "Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan," it has grown into a popular community-driven game where players can create and share their own beatmaps.<br><br>The game offers multiple modes: osu!standard (the classic click-and-drag rhythm gameplay), osu!mania (a keyboard-based mode similar to dance and rhythm games), osu!catch (where players catch falling fruits to the rhythm), and osu!taiko (drum-based gameplay). osu! is known for its high skill ceiling, competitive leaderboard, and a strong community that regularly organizes tournaments and events.<br><br>The game is free-to-play, making it accessible for everyone, and has amassed a global community of players who enjoy competing, creating beatmaps, or simply playing for fun.
